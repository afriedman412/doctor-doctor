This is an environment for workshopping deepdoctection for PDF table extraction on external machines (so I can use a GPU). I will containerize this when I get a chance, but this was just easier. (Also, <a href="https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection/tree/master/docker">these containers</a> already exist.)

Running on a Google Compute VM with Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm).

Tattooing this on my arm like Memento!
